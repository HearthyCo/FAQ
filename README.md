About Brahma and Hearthy: Brahma is the hearthy of the first hearthy model, at first Hearthy was a telemedicine project, we created with it some of the most succesfully projects in telemedicine in Spain, like Medipremium.In September 2016 we signed a contract with Medipremium and forked the project just for them, Medipremium is not open source, we are still trying to separate what legally we can and publish it  that is why you will see that parts of the code are pretty old.
